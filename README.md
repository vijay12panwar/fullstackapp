## Introduction

The Real Estate Management Application is a 3-tier architecture application built with Node.js, MongoDB, Express, and React. It includes CRUD operations for managing properties, authentication, and authorization using JWT, and a flexible property filter to refine property listings.

## Features

- CRUD operations for property management.
- User authentication and authorization with JWT.
- 3-tier architecture for a scalable and modular application.
- React application with Context API for state management.
- Flexible property filter for advanced property search.

## Architecture

The application follows a 3-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer (Frontend):** React application with a user interface for property management, authentication, and property filtering.

2. **Logic Layer (Backend):** Node.js and Express server handling CRUD operations, authentication, and authorization. MongoDB serves as the database for storing property information.

3. **Data Layer (Database):** MongoDB database for storing property data.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- React
- Context API
- JWT for authentication and authorization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- MongoDB (latest version)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-app.git
cd real-estate-app
```
Install backend dependencies:
```
cd backend
npm install
```
Set up backend environment variables:
Create a .env file in the backend directory and configure the following:
```
PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/real_estate_db
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```
Replace your_secret_key with a secure secret key for JWT authentication.

Start the backend server:
```
npm start
```
Install frontend dependencies:
```
cd ../frontend
npm install
```
Start the frontend application:
```
npm start
```
